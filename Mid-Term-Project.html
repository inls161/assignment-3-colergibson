<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Our project will be to assist our patrons in the shift from Dewey classification to Library of Congress classification. The main benefits for this project is to educate our patrons on Library of Congress classification and to foster a community of assistance between our patrons and our reference staff. It will also serve as an excellent opportunity for our staff to gain experience in instruction. Our main methods to educate our patrons will be through the use of community events that will be held every two months as well as to create educational material that will be used in these instructional sessions. These materials will also be able at our reference desk for public consumption. We expect that the budget will be low cost and that operational workflow will be negligibly affected. Our patrons will be assessed through surveys and through data mining of reference questions to see the impact of this project as well as to actively update and improve the instructional capabilities of the project.</p>
<h1 id="organization-description">Organization Description</h1>
<p>Our organization is a small private university library founded by a religious institution. It services mainly undergraduate students. While the university was initially founded with religious teachings in mind the university has in recent times begun to switch to a more liberal arts style university and the three main programs of the school have shifted to a social science leaning. The library hosts a mainly mono graphic collection with a heavy focus in collecting religious texts and scholarly writings, social science scholarship, and a sizable adult fiction section. It consists of a small staff of information professions with a dozen student employees who assist with page duties such as shelving and desk operations. All staff assist with desk responsibilities and the organization is very flat. There is a library director who communicates with university executives to negotiate budget concerns as well as to organize the library’s marketing and community outreach. The other departments that the library contain are a technical services, reference, and circulation departments. The departments do not have a director for the individual departments but employees with seniority tend to be placed into management roles as well as project leads.</p>
<p>This project will consist of a team of five members who will be drawn from the reference department as well as one individual from technical services. There will be three reference employees who are all trained in liaison style reference and are well acquainted with working the reference desk, receiving reference questions through both email and chat systems, as well as roaming reference. Each of these employees are also educated in various classification systems but have more experience with using Dewey classification. The one individual from technical services will serve as an assist to the reference librarians for when an issue with the catalog system occurs. They will also be ensuring that materials are properly labeled with Library of Congress classification. The final member of the team will be the project lead and they will be the library director. The library director will be the lead due to their familiarity with working both with the greater community and the university executives. They are also an individual who can draw the employees from different departments into a more cohesive unit.</p>
<h1 id="goals-and-outcomes">Goals and Outcomes</h1>
<p>The overall outcome for this project is to have patrons of the library be comfortable with the changes from Dewey classification to Library of Congress classification. This plan has been chosen because of its emphasis on education through workshops and events occurring after normal operational hours. Additionally this plan limits the daily time cost on our employees. This plan also has a number of benefits for our stakeholders such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Education in Library of Congress classification”</p></li>
<li><p>“Additional classes for patrons”</p></li>
<li><p>“Additional access to reference librarians”</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="action-plan">Action Plan</h1>
<p>The team members for this project consist of the library director, Director, three reference librarians; Reference 1, Reference 2, and Reference 3, as well as a member of technical services, Cataloger. A description of each member’s job and responsibilities can be found in the appendix.</p>
<p>At the start of the project there will be a team meeting that will address the classification changes and to re familiarize the team with Library of Congress classification. Each member of the project can expect an additional meeting each month to check on progress and to assess how the project is meeting the goals outlined.</p>
<p>Following the initial meeting the reference librarians will meet to coordinate when the community events will take place and how to best structure each instructional meeting. The reference librarians can expect to have community events every two months for the first 6 months of the project timeline that will be held outside of normal library operating hours. There will also be an initial creation of multimedia educational tools before the community events take place that will be completed by Cataloger and then passed to the reference librarians for distribution. After each event patrons will also be given surveys on how the event went to give the reference librarians insight into how to best build their instruction.</p>
<p>After the first six months a formal assessment will occur that will poll patrons on how they understand the classification changes as well as to count up the reference questions regarding the classification changes. This will ensure that the community events are helpful and that the information is being successfully transferred to the patrons. There will also be a second meeting among the reference librarians to assess if any more events need to be held after the first six months.</p>
<p>In regards to negative affects to daily workflow we expect that initially reference services will see an increase of traffic and questions while patrons get used to the classification changes but that throughout the year with the help of the community events and educational materials that these questions will diminish to a more normal level.</p>
<h2 id="departmental-outcomes">Departmental Outcomes</h2>
<p>The department expects to having the following benefits occur through this project plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Negligible affect on day to day operations”</p></li>
<li><p>“Opportunity for individual growth in teaching and instruction”</p></li>
<li><p>“Opportunity for greater outreach opportunities within our academic community.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Opportunity for our library to gain a better understanding of our academic community through assessment.”</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risks-and-costs">Risks and Costs</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
<ul>
<li>The budget will be a low cost expenditure due to low material needs and slightly enhanced pay for overtime work for community events.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h3 id="team-building">Team-building</h3>
<ul>
<li>The team will have monthly meetings to refocus and to assess their own performances in regards to the community events and any questions they have received while working within reference services. They will additionally have the ability to meet one on one with the project lead at a requested appointed time to individually go over any issues that they are having with the classification changes. In terms of team-building the team will have a couple of months of collaborative work before the community events begin as well as the events themselves to understand how best to work together. The events will help to showcase the particular skills of each team member through the creation of educational materials or the instruction of patrons.</li>
